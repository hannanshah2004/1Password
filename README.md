We now have a Stagehand‐powered end-to-end flow that:

 • Launches Chrome in a fresh, incognito profile (with optional proxy/stealth flags), loads the 1Password extension, and automates its “Welcome → Sign in → Email → Secret Key → Master Password” sequence with explicit waits to avoid context‐destroyed races.  
 • Switches to the 1Password web vault to search for a vault item, copies username/password via the clipboard API, and then  
 • Uses those credentials to log into Spotify (with deterministic selectors and extract-based verification).
